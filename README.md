# DevDiary - Blog for Job Search Journey

Welcome to DevDiary, a blog site where I document my job search journey as a developer. Every day, I will be posting updates in three main sections, sharing my project work, LeetCode problem solutions, and job application progress. This blog serves as a record of my daily efforts and experiences until I secure a job.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Material-UI.

Please note that an API call is made using the FormSubmit library for handling form submissions. It is recommended to read the documentation of FormSubmit before using it in your own projects to understand its functionality and implementation details.

## Daily Updates

### Project Work

In this section, I will talk about the project I worked on each day. I will provide details about the project, the tasks I accomplished, and any challenges or breakthroughs I encountered during development.

### LeetCode Prep

I am committed to improving my coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. In this section, I will solve one LeetCode problem every day and explain my thought process and solution approach. It will be a great opportunity to showcase my problem-solving skills and share my knowledge with the community.

### Job Applications

Finding the right job is a crucial part of my journey, and I will share my job application progress in this section. I will discuss the companies I applied to, the positions I pursued, and any notable experiences or insights gained from the application process.

## Closing Remarks

Job searching can be challenging, and there may be moments of discouragement. In this section, I will provide closing remarks, reflecting on the ups and downs of the job search journey. It's important to stay positive and remember that things will work out in the end.

Stay tuned for daily updates and join me on this exciting and transformative job search journey!
